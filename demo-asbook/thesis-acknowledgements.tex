Firstly, I wish to thank my thesis advisor, Associate Professor Nikolaj Zimic, without whose support this dissertation would not have been possible. Furthermore, I sincerely thank Assistant Professor Miha Mraz for the long and some times stressing discussions, which always (one way or another) resulted in my moving forward.

My special thanks go to Professor Frank H. Heppner for a prompt response to my e-mail requesting access to his publications and for later generously agreeing to serve as external examiner of my dissertation, despite his busy schedule and the long distance he had to travel.

I thank all members of the Computer Structures and Systems Laboratory who were forced to listen to my discussions related to bird flocks even in such delicate times as coffee breaks.

Last but not least, I wish to thank my beloved Maja for taking her time and reading through the manuscript and correcting all typographical errors and inserting the missing or deleting the misleading commas; TVTB.
