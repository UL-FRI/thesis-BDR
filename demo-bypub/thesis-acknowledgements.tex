  Along my epic journey as a doctoral student I was lucky enough to have met and shared parts of this pilgrimage with a number of interesting characters. Not to leave anyone out or have the acknowledgements take the major part of this book, I will, from now on, write as if we all contributed to this work (in fact we did, one way or another).
